# Optional PyPI constraints for reproducible builds.
# Generate with pip-compile (pip-tools) or `pip freeze > constraints.txt` in a clean environment.
# Leave this file empty to avoid pinning (it's safe; pip will ignore an empty constraints file).

# Example (uncomment and pin specific versions):
# numpy==1.26.4
# pandas==2.2.2
